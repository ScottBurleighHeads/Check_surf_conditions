##### Scott Malone T2A3 - Develop and Implement an Algorithm in Python

This program is used to interact with the user. It is a personal AI friend that checks the surf using an Application Programming Interface and returns the size of the surf and weather conditions. Depending on the results the program will act differently which means it will return a different string.

Starting the program for the first time the program will ask the user to set up a profile. Once the profile is set up it stores the data in a txt file for later use and will no longer ask a user to set up a profile if the program is restarted.
